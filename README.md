# SVG Logo Maker
SVG Logo Maker - Challenge #10

## Task
- Create a node program that returns an SVG file and logo by taking in user specified parameters.
- Use node and jest to create a testing suite for the js files.
- Use and SVG viewer to preview the SVG files and view the actual picture.

## Process
- Create a class and then duplicate that class in js that contains all the properties of the svg file.
- Build an index.js file the uses inquirer to prompt the user for their desired text, shape, and colors, and that also runs the class methods to return the svg file text, finally writing the file to a ".svg".
- Build a testing suite using node/jest in order to test the code that runs the svg generator. 
- Use svg viewing software to insert the svg text from the created svg file and and see the logo's appearance.

## What I Learned
- Solidified my knowledge of building classes in js and extending those classes to make new ones.
- How to create a robust testing platform using jest.
- How to use node and its different packages such as inquirer and jest.
- What an svg file looks like, how to use svg syntax, and how to view it.
- What .gitignore files can do to clean up a repository.
